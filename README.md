# CncServiceMicroservice
The architecture of this project references eshoponcontainers provided by Microsoft. 

This project aims to build a microservice to manage CNC services, including create-retrieve-update-delete (CRUD) CNC services, 
subscribe to and unsubscribe to CNC services, and more. A CNC service is a service that implements some specialized CNC functions, 
such as interpretation, velocity planning, and so on. And, several CNC services can compose a CNC system with certain functionality, 
for example, 3-axis milling CNC. 

In short, we would like to develop CNC software with high openness degree based on service-oriented architecture (SOA) instead of 
component-based architecture (CBA).The whole CNC software is built based on microservice architecture. CncServiceMicroservice is one of 
its microservices who plays a role of a service registry. 

This project is in progress.
